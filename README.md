# APG (Android Privacy Guard)

APG originally brought email encryption to the Android platform.

In recent years the project has fallen asleep, but a lot of great work has been done in [OpenKeychain](https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain), which is a fork of APG and it has a much more active and well managed development community.

I recommend using OpenKeychain and to post any feature requests on their [github repository](https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain). Bugs in the APG app likely have been fixed there already.

I'm going to close all issues on this repository. Thank you for the support and interest in APG!
